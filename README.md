# JBomberman

JBomberman is a project developed as part of the Methodologies of Programming course at the University of Sapienza in Rome. This README provides an overview of the project and the design decisions made during development.

## Key Features

- **MVC Design Pattern**: The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for better code organization and clear separation of responsibilities.
- **Game Screen Management**: The GameController manages the different game screens, allowing smooth transition between them.
- **Level Management**: The game supports multiple levels, managed by the GameController, which handles loading the map, enemies, and destructible objects for each level.
- **Graphical Interface with Java Swing**: The graphical interface is implemented using Java Swing for easy user interaction.
- **User Profile Management**: A dedicated screen allows users to track their games played, won, and lost, as well as showing the player's avatar and level.
- **Save Game Management**: The game supports saving functionality, storing user progress in a text file.
- **Map and Asset Management**: The game map is managed through a text file, while graphical assets are organized following a specific pattern for easy and modular management.

## System Requirements

- **Java**: JBomberman requires Java to run.
- **Java Swing**: For the graphical interface.
