I didn't make the art myself, some of it is taken from the original Bomberman game, while the rest is from Discord of Power Bomberman.
Credits to booz12345_7801 on Discord for the Johnny Bravo skin.

I can't find the creators of the pirate ship map, the lab map, and the Homer Simpson skin. If you are one of them, please contact me.
